# Testing Telnyx Email safely with sandbox recipients

Use `sandbox_mode: true` to test your integration without delivering real mail through the MTA. Sandbox sends are non-billable, consume no sending quota, and their outcomes are excluded from production deliverability statistics and reputation scoring.

## Send a sandbox message

Use your API key and an authorized sender, and explicitly enable sandbox mode:

```sh
curl -X POST "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/email_messages" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "sender@mail.yourcompany.com",
    "to": ["delivered@test.telnyx.com"],
    "subject": "Sandbox delivery test",
    "text_body": "Exercise my event handler safely.",
    "sandbox_mode": true
  }'
```

The accepted single-send response returns `202` and parent status `sandbox`. Save its message ID. Sandbox still validates your request and sender permissions; it is not an authentication bypass.

The reserved addresses below simulate outcomes **only in sandbox mode**. An address alone does not enable sandbox: always set `sandbox_mode: true`. Do not use these recipients for a production delivery test.

## Choose a deterministic recipient

Use these exact eight addresses at `test.telnyx.com`:

| Recipient | Simulated outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `delivered@test.telnyx.com` | Successful delivery (`email.delivered`). |
| `hard-bounce@test.telnyx.com` | Permanent bounce (`email.bounced`, simulated SMTP `550`, enhanced code `5.1.1`). |
| `soft-bounce@test.telnyx.com` | Soft bounce (`email.bounced`, simulated SMTP `450`, enhanced code `4.2.0`). This is a synthetic soft-bounce outcome, not queue expiry. |
| `complaint@test.telnyx.com` | Complaint (`email.complained`). |
| `suppressed@test.telnyx.com` | Suppression (`email.suppressed`, reason `suppressed_recipient`). |
| `invalid@test.telnyx.com` | Failure (`email.failed`, reason `invalid_recipient`). |
| `dkim-fail@test.telnyx.com` | Failure (`email.failed`, reason `dkim_unavailable`). |
| `rate-limit@test.telnyx.com` | Failure (`email.failed`, reason `rate_limit_exceeded`). This simulates an outcome, not an actual quota or request-rate rejection. |

These are simulated recipient events on an accepted sandbox message, not real delivery attempts or promises about production failure timing. The parent remains a sandbox message; inspect recipient events for the selected outcome.

## Check polling and webhooks

Retrieve the message with `GET /v2/email_messages/{message_id}` and its history with `GET /v2/email_messages/{message_id}/events`. For event IDs and recipient correlation, use account event polling filtered to the message:

```sh
curl --get "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/email_events" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  --data-urlencode 'filter[message_id]={message_id}'
```

Simulated events are stored and pollable. They are also delivered to the message's configured webhooks when the subscription includes the matching event classes, such as `email.delivered`, `email.bounced`, `email.complained`, `email.suppressed`, or `email.failed`. Subscribe to `email.sandbox` if you also want the sandbox acceptance event. `email.sending` is not published as a webhook.

Create or update your subscription before sending a new test message. Webhook settings are snapshotted when a message is accepted. The event and recipient IDs stay stable across account event polling and webhook delivery; use the event envelope ID for deduplication and the payload message/recipient IDs for correlation. Webhooks are at-least-once, so your handler must tolerate duplicate deliveries.

For several outcomes in one request, use [batch sending](https://support.telnyx.com/en/articles/16823821-sending-email-in-batches-limits-results-and-safe-retries) and set `sandbox_mode: true` on each message item. A processed batch returns `207` with per-item results, including sandbox statuses for accepted sandbox items.
