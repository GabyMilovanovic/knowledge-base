# Understanding Telnyx Email errors and message size limits

Telnyx Email has two different kinds of errors: request errors returned immediately by the API and delivery errors produced after a message is accepted. Use this guide to tell them apart, read the right fields, and decide whether a retry is safe.

---

## **Start with the HTTP response**

Send requests return a standard `errors` array when the API cannot accept the message. Use `-i` while troubleshooting so you can see the HTTP status as well as the JSON body:

```
curl -i -X POST "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/email_messages" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "sender@mail.yourcompany.com",
    "to": ["recipient@example.com"],
    "subject": "Order update",
    "text_body": "Your order has shipped."
  }'
```

Each immediate error contains `code`, `title`, and `detail`, and may include a `source` pointer. Fix the field or account condition named in `detail` before retrying.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Common response** | **What to do** |
| `400` / `10015` | Correct the malformed, missing, or conflicting request field. |
| `401` or `403` | Check the API key, account state, permissions, trial-recipient restrictions, or sender-domain eligibility. |
| `422` with `scheduled_at` field detail | Correct the invalid or past timestamp; it does not trigger an immediate send. |
| `422 recipient_suppressed` | Every recipient was suppressed, so no message was created. Inspect the top-level `suppressed` array. |
| `429` | Read the error code before retrying. A daily quota can be retried after reset, but `reputation_suspended` requires remediation rather than an automatic retry loop. |

---

## **Batch responses**

`POST /v2/email_messages/batch` accepts at most 1,000 messages; 1,001 is rejected with `400`. A processed batch always returns `207 Multi-Status`, including all-success and all-failure results. Inspect the indexed per-item `errors` and successful `data`; do not apply the single-send status model to a batch. See [Sending email in batches: limits, results, and safe retries](https://support.telnyx.com/en/articles/16823821-sending-email-in-batches-limits-results-and-safe-retries) for whole-request idempotency and safe retries.

---

## **Keep the size limits separate**

The Email API, its HTTP parser, and Edge idempotency enforce different limits. They do not all return the same status.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Limit** | **What is measured** | **Result when exceeded** |
| 1 MB | Decoded `html_body` plus `text_body`. | `422`: body exceeds the size limit. |
| 25 MB | Decoded bodies plus decoded attachment bytes. Base64 characters are not the attachment measurement. | `422`: message exceeds the size limit. |
| 150 MB | The complete HTTP request handled by the Email API parser. | The request is rejected before normal send validation. |
| 8,000,000 bytes | The raw request body only when `Idempotency-Key` is present on the send endpoint. | Edge returns `413 Payload Too Large`; the Email API never receives it. |

An unkeyed request bypasses the 8,000,000-byte Edge cap, but it is still subject to the 1 MB body, 25 MB total-message, and 150 MB parser limits.

## **Read delivery errors after acceptance**

A `202 Accepted` response means Telnyx created the message; it does not guarantee final delivery. Retrieve the message event history with the message ID:

```
curl "https://api.telnyx.com/v2/email_messages/{message_id}/events" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Delivery failures use normalized 30xxx codes. Raw SMTP evidence, when available, is preserved separately.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Code** | **Meaning** | **Action** |
| `30001` | Hard bounce | Do not retry the same address. Correct it or remove it. |
| `30002` | Deferred | Temporary SMTP failure. This is the retryable 30xxx outcome. |
| `30003` | Injection failure | Do not retry automatically. Record the evidence and investigate the injection failure. |
| `30004` | Suppressed recipient | Defined for normalized delivery records, but the public send-time path filters suppressions before recipient persistence. All-suppressed sends instead return synchronous `422 recipient_suppressed`. |
| `30005` | Queue expiry | Terminal `expired` outcome. Investigate repeated deferrals before attempting another send. |
| `30006` | Gateway rejection | The recipient was rejected before it entered the delivery queue. Do not assume it is billable or safe to retry. |
| `30099` | Internal error | Do not loop automatically. Preserve the message and recipient IDs and contact support if it persists. |

**Read the canonical outcome.** Webhooks and event polling expose an additive `canonical_event_type` while compatibility names remain available:

| Outcome | Compatibility `event_type` / webhook name | `canonical_event_type` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway rejection | `email.failed` | `email.gw_reject` |
| Ambiguous injection timeout | `email.injection_timeout` | `email.injection_timeout` |
| Queue expiry | `email.bounced` | `email.expired` |
| Other system failure | `email.failed` | `email.failed` |

The compatibility name alone cannot distinguish gateway rejection from another system failure, or expiry from a bounce. Use `canonical_event_type` together with `error_evidence`. Older records without enough recorded evidence may retain a generic canonical name; do not infer a more specific outcome.

Queue expiry is terminal `expired`, with delivery code `30005`; it is not a generic retryable failure.

## **Use error\_evidence as the decision record**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Field** | **Meaning** |
| `code` | Normalized Telnyx 30xxx outcome. |
| `message` | Available delivery detail. It may come from an MTA or operator path, so do not always label it as remote-server text. |
| `enhanced_code` | Enhanced SMTP status when available, such as `5.1.1`. |
| `smtp_status` | Raw SMTP numeric status, kept separate from the normalized code. |
| `source` | The classifying layer, such as `smtp`, `mta`, or `api`. |
| `retryable` | Whether the normalized delivery outcome is safe to treat as temporary. |

---

## **What to include in a support request**

Include the Telnyx message ID, recipient ID, UTC occurrence time, HTTP status, API error object, and delivery `error_evidence`. Never include your API key or the message body.
